    <p>How do I measure my head? <br />
      We offer a range of cap sizes, which typically fits 95% of women with a head circumference between 21-23‚Äù.

    <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">Understanding Wig Cap Sizing</h4>
    <p>Don&apos;t worry too much about getting an exact cap size match. While I typically wear a 21-inch circumference, I&apos;ve successfully worn 24-inch wigs using a glueless application. Here&apos;s why this works:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li><b>The Band is Key:</b> The elastic band is the most crucial element for a secure, glueless fit. The cap size mainly affects comfort rather than security.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">Size Differences Are Minimal</h4>
    <p>To put size differences in perspective:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>One inch is roughly the size of your fingernail</li>
      <li>Half an inch is even smaller</li>
      <li>A slight measurement difference won&apos;t drastically impact your overall fit</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
